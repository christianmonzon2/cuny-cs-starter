<h2> Movie Night </h2>
<p> On Tuesday, I went to watch a movie called "Together" at AMC with my friend. I didn't know much about
     what the movie was going to be like but I knew that it was a horror film about a couple who start to 
     fuse. It was a weird movie but I still enjoyed it. Here is a list of food that we ate during the movie:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Chipotle</li>
        <li>Buffalo Chicken Pizza</li>
        <li>Soda</li>
     </ul>
